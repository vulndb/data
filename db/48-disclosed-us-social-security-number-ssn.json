      "Initially, the SSN within the response should be checked to ensure its", 
      "validity, as it is possible that the regular expression has matched a", 
      "similar number with no relation to a real SSN.\n\nIf the response does", 
      "contain a valid SSN, then all efforts should be taken to remove or", 
      "further protect this information. This can be achieved by removing the", 
      "SSN altogether or by masking the number so that only the last few", 
      "digits are present within the response (eg. _**********123_)."
