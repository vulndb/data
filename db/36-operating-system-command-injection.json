    "To perform specific actions from within a web application, it is", 
    "occasionally required to run Operating System commands and have the", 
    "output of these commands captured by the web application and returned", 
    "to the client.\n\nOS command injection occurs when user supplied input", 
    "is inserted into one of these commands without proper sanitisation and", 
    "is then executed by the server.\n\nCyber-criminals will abuse this", 
    "weakness to perform their own arbitrary commands on the server. This", 
    "can include everything from simple `ping` commands to map the internal", 
    "network, to obtaining full control of the server.\n\nThe tool was able to", 
    "inject specific Operating System commands and have the output from", 
    "that command contained within the server response. This indicates that", 
    "proper input sanitisation is not occurring."

      "required to perform the required action.\n\nFor example, where the form", 
      "field expects an IP address, only numbers and periods should be", 
      "accepted. Additionally, all control operators (`&`, `&&`, `|`, `||`,", 
      "`$`, `\\`, `#`) should be explicitly denied and never accepted as valid",
