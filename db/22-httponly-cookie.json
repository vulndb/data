  "description": [
    "HTTP by itself is a stateless protocol. Therefore the server is unable", 
    "to determine which requests are performed by which client, and which", 
    "clients are authenticated or unauthenticated.\n\nThe use of HTTP cookies", 
    "within the headers, allows a web server to identify each individual", 
    "client and can therefore determine which clients hold valid", 
    "authentication, from those that do not. These are known as session", 
    "cookies.\n\nWhen a cookie is set by the server (sent the header of an", 
    "HTTP response) there are several flags that can be set to configure", 
    "the properties of the cookie and how it is to be handled by the", 
    "browser.\n\nThe `HttpOnly` flag assists in the prevention of client", 
    "side-scripts (such as JavaScript) accessing and using the cookie.", 
    "This can help prevent XSS attacks targeting the cookies holding the", 
    "client's session token (setting the `HttpOnly` flag does not prevent,", 
    "nor safeguard against XSS vulnerabilities themselves)."

    "guidance": [
      "The initial step to remedy this would be to determine whether any", 
      "client-side scripts (such as JavaScript) need to access the cookie and", 
      "if not, set the `HttpOnly` flag.\n\nAdditionally, it should be noted", 
      "that some older browsers are not compatible with the `HttpOnly` flag,", 
      "and therefore setting this flag will not protect those clients against", 
      "this form of attack."
