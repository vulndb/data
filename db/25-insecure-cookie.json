    "HTTP by itself is a stateless protocol. Therefore the server is unable", 
    "to determine which requests are performed by which client, and which", 
    "clients are authenticated or unauthenticated.\n\nThe use of HTTP cookies", 
    "within the headers, allows a web server to identify each individual", 
    "client and can therefore determine which clients hold valid", 
    "authentication, from those that do not. These are known as session", 
    "cookies.\n\nWhen a cookie is set by the server (sent the header of an", 
    "HTTP response) there are several flags that can be set to configure", 
    "the properties of the cookie and how it is to be handled by the", 
    "browser.\n\nOne of these flags is known as the `secure` flag. When the", 
    "secure flag is set, the browser will prevent it from being sent over a", 
    "clear text channel (HTTP) and only allow it to be sent when an", 
    "encrypted channel is used (HTTPS).\n\nThe tool discovered that a cookie", 
    "was set by the server without the secure flag being set. Although the", 
    "initial setting of this cookie was via an HTTPS connection, any HTTP", 
    "link to the same server will result in the cookie being send in clear", 
    "text."

      "The initial steps to remedy this should be determined on whether the",

      "sensitive information then the risk of this vulnerability is reduced;", 
      "however, if the cookie does contain sensitive information, then the", 
      "server should ensure that the cookie has its `secure` flag set."
