    "they can easily return to the server if required. One method of", 
    "achieving this is to place a web backdoor or web shell within the web", 
    "root of the web server. This will then enable the cyber-criminal to", 
    "access the server through a HTTP/S session.\n\nAlthough extremely bad", 
    "practice, it is possible that the web backdoor or web shell has been", 
    "placed there by an administrator so they can perform administrative", 
    "activities remotely.\n\nDuring the initial recon stages of an attack,", 
    "cyber-criminals will attempt to locate these web backdoors or shells", 
    "by requesting the names of the most common and well known ones.\n\nBy", 
    "analysing the response, they are able to determine if a web backdoor", 
    "or web shell exists. These web backdoors or web shells can then", 
    "provide an easy path for further compromise of the server.\n\nBy", 
    "utilising the same methods as the cyber-criminals, the tool was able to", 
    "discover a possible web backdoor or web shell."

      "compromise of any other services or servers should be conducted."
