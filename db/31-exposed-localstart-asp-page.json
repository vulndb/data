    "To restrict access to specific pages on a webserver, developers can", 
    "implement various methods of authentication, therefore only allowing", 
    "access to clients with valid credentials. There are several forms of", 
    "authentication that can be used. The simplest forms of authentication", 
    "are known as 'Basic' and 'Basic Realm'. These methods of", 
    "authentication have several known weaknesses such as being susceptible", 
    "to brute force attacks.\n\nAdditionally, when utilising the NTLM", 
    "mechanism in a windows environment, several disclosures of information", 
    "exist, and any brute force attack occurs against the server's local", 
    "users, or domain users if the web server is a domain member.", 
    "Cyber-criminals will attempt to locate protected pages to gain access", 
    "to them and also perform brute force attacks to discover valid", 
    "credentials.\n\nThe tool discovered the following page requires NTLM", 
    "based basic authentication in order to be accessed."

      "protect against pages requiring authentication.\n\nIf NTLM based basic", 
      "authentication must be used, then default server and domain accounts", 
      "such as `administrator` and `root` should be disabled, as these will", 
      "undoubtedly be the first accounts to be targeted in any such attack.", 
      "Additionally, the webserver should not be joined to any corporate", 
      "domain where usernames are readily available (such as from email", 
      "addresses). If the pages are required, and it is possible to remove", 
      "the basic authentication, then a stronger and more resilient", 
      "form-based authentication mechanism should be implemented to protect", 
      "the affected pages."
