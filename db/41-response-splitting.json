    "HTTP response splitting occurs when untrusted data is inserted into", 
    "the response headers without any sanitisation.\n\nIf successful, this", 
    "allows cyber-criminals to essentially split the HTTP response in two.", 
    "This is abused by cyber-criminals injecting CR (Carriage Return --", 
    "`/r`) and LF (Line Feed -- `\n`) characters which will then form the", 
    "split. If the CR or LF characters are not processed by the server then", 
    "it cannot be exploited.\n\nAlong with these characters, cyber-criminals", 
    "can then construct their own arbitrary response headers and body which", 
    "would then form the second response. The second response is entirely", 
    "under their control, allowing for a number of other attacks."
