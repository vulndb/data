    "XML Path Language (XPath) queries are used by web applications for", 
    "selecting nodes from XML documents. Once selected, the value of these", 
    "nodes can then be used by the application.\n\nA simple example for the", 
    "use of XML documents is to store user information. As part of the", 
    "authentication process, the application will perform an XPath query to", 
    "confirm the login credentials and retrieve that user's information to", 
    "use in the following request.\n\nXPath injection occurs where untrusted", 
    "data is used to build XPath queries.\n\nCyber-criminals may abuse this", 
    "injection vulnerability to bypass authentication, query other user's", 
    "information, or, if the XML document contains privileged user", 
    "credentials, allow the cyber-criminal to escalate their privileges.", 
    "The tool injected special XPath query characters into the page and", 
    "based on the responses from the server, has determined that the page", 
    "is vulnerable to XPath injection."

      "The preferred way to protect against XPath injection is to utilise", 
      "parameterized (also known as prepared) XPath queries. When utilising", 
      "this method of querying the XML document any value supplied by the", 
      "client will be handled as a string rather than part of the XPath", 
      "query.\n\nAn alternative to parameterized queries it to use precompiled", 
      "XPath queries. Precompiled XPath queries are not generated dynamically", 
      "and will therefor never process user supplied input as XPath."
